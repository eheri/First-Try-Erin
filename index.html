<h2>My School</h2>
<p> Hi! My name is Erin Heritage and I am a freshman at the University of New Haven majoring in Paramedicine. The University of New Haven is located in West Haven, Connecticut and is well-known for forensic science. The school is also popular because of the various internship and experiential learning opportunities given to all students. As a paramedic student, I am able, and required, to work with local ambulance services to gain experience, as well as in Yale-New Haven's Emergency Department. At the end of this year, I will be a fully certified EMT and by the time I graduate, I will be a licensed paramedic, ready to go into the field! (and get paid for it) </p>

<h3>Fun Stuff</h3>
<p> Outside of class or the emergency room, I am also in the honors program, a member of the Rotaract Club, and a midfielder on the women's lacrosse team. In my free time and over the summer, I love traveling, reading, and spending time with my family and friends. I currently live in San Diego, California and have an older sister and a younger brother. My dad is in the military and my mom works with special-needs students at an elementary school. My favorite soda is Dr. Pepper and I love cheesecake. </p>
